# Ad-free, algorithm free, privacy-focused bookmarking.

BookLeaf is a simple, private way to store and organize your bookmarks. Here's what this project is all about:

- No fancy frontend frameworks (pages are measured in a single kB request, not MBs worth of requests)
- Maintainable code that's easy to deploy
- Private by default, no tracking scripts (heck no scripts at all)
- Works on any device or network connection
- User feedback driven
- Exportable data
